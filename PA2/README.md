<h1>PA1-Programming and algorithmic 2</h1>
<h2>Course Annotation</h2>
<p>This module is an introduction to the object-oriented programming style. Abstract data types (stack, queue, vector, map, …​) are used to demonstrate object specification and implementation. The implementation language is C++. Even though C++ is not the main objective, the module includes all the important aspects of the language (classes, templates, inheritance, exceptions, etc.).</p>
